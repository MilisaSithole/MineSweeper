# Minesweeper Game

Hello, welcome to my Minesweeper game! This game was developed by me as a fun project to recreate the classic Minesweeper game that many of us enjoyed in our childhood.

## Running the Game

This game is developed in Processing. To run the game, you need to have Processing installed on your computer. You can [download](https://processing.org/download) Processing from their official website.

## Future Plans

In the future, I plan to develop an AI that can play this game. The goal is to create an intelligent agent that can navigate through the minefield with the highest possible success rate. Stay tuned for updates on this exciting addition!

## How to Play

Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle game. The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.

Here are the basic steps to play the game:

1. **Start a new game**: A game is initiated by clicking on any cell in the grid. The clicked cell reveals the number of mines in the adjacent cells or a mine. [Your first click will never be a mine, I'm a good developer :)]

2. **Interpret the numbers**: Each number tells you how many mines touch the cell. You can use this information to figure out which cells are safe, and which are mines.

3. **Clear the safe cells**: Left-click on a cell to clear it if you think it's safe.

4. **Flag the mines**: If you think a cell is a mine, right-click on it to put a flag. 

5. **Win the game**: The game is won when all the safe cells are cleared.

6. **Game over**: Once the game is lost or won, just click again to play again. [or press the 'R' key at any time to reset the game]

Enjoy the game!
